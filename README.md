This project represents a training endeavor in building a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core.

Leveraging the capabilities of ASP.NET Core and Microsoft's HttpClientFactory, the API is designed to facilitate seamless communication with external services.

The architecture adheres to best practices, employing interfaces for dependency injection and async/await patterns for efficient asynchronous operations.

Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented, featuring custom exception handling to gracefully manage API errors and provide user-friendly feedback.

Key Learning Points:

- Utilization of ASP.NET Core for building web APIs.
- Implementation of HttpClientFactory for efficient HTTP communication.
- Application of interfaces for dependency injection.
- Adoption of async/await patterns for asynchronous programming.
- Incorporation of robust error handling techniques.
- Designing RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Integration of input data validation using ModelState and annotations.
- Emphasis on reliability, performance, and maintainability in development practices.
  
Through this project, developers can gain valuable insights into modern API development practices, enhancing their skills in building scalable and resilient applications.
